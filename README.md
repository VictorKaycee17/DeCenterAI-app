# DeCenter AI B2B API Platform - Access to 400+ premium AI models and agents for $0.01 USDC.

A fast, unified way for businesses to generate API keys and connect to our global network of AI models and agents.

---

## 🚀 Overview
DeCenter AI is a unified AI studio that connects users to thousands of premium AI tools through a Super Agent that intelligently matches every prompt to the most effective model — for just $0.01 per inference.**.

The platform provides developers with easy API access to an **AI network of 400+ models and agents**, powered by **Hedera’s Consensus Service (HCS)** for transparent inference tracking and **Hedera Token Service (HTS)** for seamless microtransactions in **HBAR**.

DeCenter AI bridges **AI & DePIN** — combining smart autonomous AI systems with decentralized infrastructure for trust, scalability, and accessibility.

## 🧩 Problems We Solve

Today’s AI landscape is fragmented and expensive.

- **Too Many Options:** Hundreds of apps that do the same thing with minor variations, creating confusion and inefficiency.  
- **Too Many Payments:** Every tool requires a separate subscription, making AI usage costly and unsustainable.  
- **Too Much Hassle:** Users switch between multiple platforms just to complete a single task, wasting time and energy.  

---

## 💰 Market Opportunity

This fragmentation fuels the massive gap between free and premium AI users.

- **TAM:** $305B AI Market  
- **SAM:** 1.8B total AI users  
- **SOM:** 1.7B free AI users (97% use only free versions)  

💭 *What if we could bring the best of AI to the 97%, at near-zero cost?*

---

## ⚙️ How We Solve It

We are building a **Unified AI Studio** that connects users to thousands of premium AI tools, powered by a **Super Agent** that automatically selects the best-performing model for every prompt — for just **one cent per inference**.

---

## 🦾 The Product We Built

For the hackathon, we built a **B2B platform** that allows developers and organizations to:

- Generate API keys to access our AI network.  
- Connect directly to over **400+ AI models and agents**.  
- Pay just **$0.01 per inference**.  

This enables anyone to power their applications with high-quality AI — seamlessly and affordably.

## 💡 Innovation and Hedera Integrations

Our architecture is built on three core principles:

- **Agentic:** Intelligent orchestration of AI agent results.  
- **Agnostic:** Accessible across any connected device or platform.  
- **Abstracted:** API-native for effortless integration and deployment.  

### Hedera AI Agent Integrations:

- **LangGraph / LangChain** – Dynamic AI orchestration.  
- **ILM (Inference Lifecycle Management)** – Performance optimization.  
- **Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)** – Records inference logs and verification hashes.  
- **Hedera Token Service (HTS)** – Processes microtransactions in HBAR via testnet wallets.  

**Workflow:**  
`Prompt → AI Selection (via Super Agent) → Hedera Registry (HCS Logging) → Output Delivery`

---

## 🔲 Core Impact

DeCenter AI empowers developers and businesses to:

- Access premium AI capabilities without enterprise pricing barriers.  
- Build trustworthy AI applications with verifiable inference records.  
- Reduce AI infrastructure costs by over **90%** using decentralized micro-billing.  
- Support community-powered AI infrastructure running on Hedera, aligning with the **AI & DePIN mission** of building smarter, decentralized systems.
